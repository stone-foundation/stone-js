Scaffold a new Stone.js app in seconds using your terminal.

---

## Overview

**Create Stone App** is the official scaffolding tool for Stone.js, designed to get your project up and running in just a few commands.

It powers the command:

```bash
npm create @stone-js/stone
```

Under the hood, it clones a project starter, asks you a few questions, and sets up your application based on your choices.

## Usage

To create a new Stone.js project:

```bash
npm create @stone-js/stone
```

Or with a custom project name:

```bash
npm create @stone-js/stone my-app
```

The tool will guide you through an interactive setup and generate a ready-to-run Stone.js application.

You can then:

```bash
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## What You Get

Depending on your choices, the tool can scaffold:

* Backend, frontend, or fullstack apps
* React or Vue view layer
* SPA or SSR rendering strategy
* Basic, standard, or full application layout
* Local development support with `stone serve`
* Production-ready structure with `stone build` and `stone preview`
